    "content": "<h3>The Art of Subtraction</h3><p>Minimalism isn't just about having less; it's about making room for more of what matters. In landscape architecture, this translates to clean lines, intentional negative space, and a restrained palette of materials.</p><h3>Structural Rigidity vs. Organic Form</h3><p>We often contrast strict geometric hardscaping—concrete pavers, steel planters—with the softness of ornamental grasses and native wildflowers. This tension creates visual interest without clutter.</p><h3>Key Elements</h3><ul><li><strong>Monochromatic Palette:</strong> Sticking to green, grey, and wood tones.</li><li><strong>Boulders:</strong> Using large stones as sculptural elements.</li><li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Subtle uplighting to highlight architectural trees.</li></ul>"

Too much hardscape creates heat islands and drainage issues; too much softscape can be high maintenance.</p><h3>The 70/30 Rule</h3><p>We generally aim for a 30% hardscape to 70% softscape ratio for residential gardens to ensure adequate groundwater recharge.</p><h3>Permeable Solutions</h3><p>Using gravel, permeable pavers, or spaced decking allows us to create usable living areas while still allowing water to return to the earth.</p>"
